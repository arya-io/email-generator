    This app is a **Cold Email Generator** designed to help business professionals quickly generate personalized cold emails for job opportunities 
    listed on websites. It allows users to input a URL for a job listing, then extracts relevant job details (such as role, skills, and experience) 
    from the page using AI. The user can also input their name, designation, and company details, which are then used to automatically craft a professional 
    cold email tailored to the job description. The app also integrates the userâ€™s company portfolio links to showcase relevant work.
